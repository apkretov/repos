Options That Control Optimization

   Most optimizations are only enabled if an -O level is set on the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual optimization flags are
   specified.

   -O0 Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results.  This is the default.


Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC

   -g  Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this debugging information.

       GCC allows you to use -g with -O.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally produce surprising results: some variables you declared may
       not exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
       results or their values are already at hand; some statements may execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
